In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

    describe refers to a suite of tests, kind of like a main folder. 
    Every test is within an it, which includes a description of what
    is being tested under the main category of describe.

What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

    It forces you to think about what the output of a certain function or component is.
    It helps you understand the purpose of all the functions being written, it also helps
    you to write more thorough code. It will help you to consider the user a little more.

Mention three types of automated tests.

    Unit Testing
    End-to-end Testing
    Integration Testing
    Component Testing
    Snapshot Testing

    Every test has a purpose. The unit test is the simplest and easiest to write. This 
    deals with the smallest parts of a file, like an individual function. Other tests are
    more involved and include testing many files working together. Tests also go beyond 
    BackEnd. Component and Snapshot Testing work with the FrontEnd user experience, making
    sure everything displays properly or an entire component is not changed.
