1. In Mocha ```before```, ```after```, ```beforeEach```, and ```afterEach```  are hooks that are ran before /after it() or describe(). ```before``` is ran before the first or main it()/describe(). ```after``` is ran after the last or main it()/describe().  ```beforeEach```, and ```afterEach``` are used after each inner it()/ and describe.

2. Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

3. A test spy is a function that records arguments, return value, the value of this and exception thrown (if any) for all its calls. There are two types of spies: Some are anonymous functions, while others wrap methods that already exist in the system under test.
