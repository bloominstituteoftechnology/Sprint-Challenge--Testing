1. In Mocha, what are the differences between `before` `after` `beforeEach` `afterEach`? When do they run? What are they used for?
  Sometimes you need to setup test data or code (typically variable and or objects) before testing
  and after testing you often need to reinitialize (teardown) things when finished. You abstract this out to setup functions and they are run once on the test suite if they are called 'before' and 'after' and they run for each testcase if called 'beforeEach' and 'afterEach'. 
1. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you personally think about this approach?
   For express routes .. no point really (quick to manually test and they shouldn't change that much often after the initial build) . However tdd can be very benefitial for shall we say imperative and complicated code bases with lots of intricate edge cases and lots of shared global variables. The chances of minor code changes leading to broken functionality elsewhere is considerable. Tdd mitigates this by covering as much of your code as possible with automated unit tests . It's intended that you write your failing tests first and then get them to pass by witing code to which the test pass asserestions against. Often some code is writen and unit tests after. It's considered bad practice to write tests after you think you have your code written as you often have no time to write tests and writing tests help you document your code and you learn more about the functionality when you think about tests. 
1. What is a `spy` in `sinon`? How do we use it to effectively test a `callback`?
  // usiing https://www.sitepoint.com/sinon-tutorial-javascript-testing-mocks-spies-stubs/ as a reference
  Sinon helps you to reduce complexity in tests by allowing you to create test doubles. Test doubles are replacements for code used in your tests. It it used for spies (gives information on function calls), mocks and stubs.
