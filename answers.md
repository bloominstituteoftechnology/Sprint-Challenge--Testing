1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe is a way of bundling tests and it details what each test does. Describe is good to bundle a bunch of it() tests under one Feature you are trying to test.

1. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
It is to make test before you code and test all the possible ways code can go wrong to reduce bugs. I think this approach is good to make sure your code is working the way it should without having to go to a browser to test for front end and requires less use of third party applications to test back end code.

1. Mention three types of automated tests.
Components tests, Unit tests, and Intregration tests.
