1. In Mocha, what are the differences between `before` `after` `beforeEach` `afterEach`? When do they run? What are they used for?
	- Before/ after are called before and after a describe, respectively. Before each & after each are called before and after each individual test in a describe is ran. They are used to duplicate functionality that you may have in multiple tests.
1. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you personally think about this approach?
	- The point of test driven development is to encourage developers to write code that meets the expectations of specific test cases. The unit test cases are written before the software is written. I think considering edge cases and writing specific tests to handle them makes the development process more robust and helps mitigate user contact with errors. It also helps to motivate specific design decisions that directly extend functionality or improve the product in some way.
1. What is a `spy` in `sinon`? How do we use it to effectively test a `callback`?
	- A test spy is a function that records arguments, the return value, the value of this and exceptions thrown for all of it's calls. Spies can be either anonymous functions or they can wrap pre-existing functions. We can use it to verify that a callback function has been called and to track the amount of times a callback function has been called.
