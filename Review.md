# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    Describe() allows for an outer layer to describe what's your overall test, while it() and test() will describe and test specific components.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    The point of TDD is to write the tests first and then the functional code, by doing it in this order you get to organize your thought process and make sure the test are completed.
    
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    Mocks simulate objects to find potential bugs.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
