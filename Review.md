# Please answer the following questions

1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
a. Describe is a parent container that should hold it() functions and describe a group of it() functions.
b. it() functions are used for the actual tests themselves and hold a string that describes the test it will perform as well.
2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
a. I think the point of TDD is to make high-quality software from the standpoint of ensuring things will work from a test first perspective. However, the software will only be as good as the test that are written. Furthermore, doing TDD makes the developer prove that they understand the nuances of the code they are writing.
3. What are `mocks`? What are good use cases for them?
a. Mocks are components that are composed together to create software under the single responsibility principle, so they are typically tested with unit tests which ares tests that focus on testing the components independently from other components.
4. Mention three types of automated tests.
a. Unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.
