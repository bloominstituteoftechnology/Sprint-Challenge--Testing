# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

- `describe()` can be used to organize your tests by type, which can make your code organized and easier to read. `it()` is used for the actual test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

- Test Drive Development allows you to write your tests before you write the actual code. I think that there is a lot of merit to this approach, as you are trying to come up with all the cases where your application/code might run into problems (break), and then you have ways to test it. From a productivity standpoint, this type of workflow makes sense to me; as you are starting to build your project, you want to think about potential issues, and then you can write the tests. When the code is written and the tests are run, you can then get your feedback about those potential problems and ensure that you have a solution.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

- Unit tests, Integration tests, and Component testing.
