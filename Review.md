# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
`describe()` provides a context for a "block" of related tests. `it()` provides context for a single test.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
`TDD` is a development paradigm in which programming of the product code is preceded by tests of presupposed functionality.  At the moment, I think `TDD` is tedious and EATS TIME.  In that, one has to debug test code on top of product code.  
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?  `Mocks` are fake instances of data used to test code functionality(?), as opposed to using a prexisting data source.  A good use case would be the contrived game data we used for this Sprint.    
4.  Mention three types of tests.  Unit, integration, and regression.
