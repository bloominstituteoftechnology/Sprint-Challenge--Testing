# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe is used to break up your tests into different parts. You group similar tests inside a describe. It is used to preform individual tests.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
TDD is when you write the tests first, and go from there. It is thought to make your code have less bugs and have more "test-coverage". I personaly think its great to do TDD, but it is hard to think ahead to all the different endpoints that you will be building

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
unit .
component.
snapshot.
