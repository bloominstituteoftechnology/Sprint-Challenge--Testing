# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    A: Describe() is used for order of execution of it(). it() is the actual test being ran. The test file will run all describe() and the runs all the it() after in order they were encountered.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    A: The point is to think about the function you are wanting to create and creating tests that check that criteria or a list of required features are working correctly. You can then go in and create your function to accomplish these tests. I think its a very beneficial way of coding especially when you are first learning. Its structured like a lot of code challenges that test what you have submitted.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
    A: Mocks are used for testing functions in jest by generating a mock result of a javascript function.
4.  Mention three types of tests.
    A: Unit Testing, Snapshot Testing, Web API Testing
