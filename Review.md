2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    TDD is basically writing the test first, and as you move forward, you will write the actuall code, this way, it ensures that the code is bug free, and is doing what is expected out of it. It is slower at the biggning, but helps write clean code at the end, that doesnt have bug.

    Mocking is a function that jest provides, and its good use case would be when you are testing react HOC component, would could mock behavior of some of the dependent components.

    unity testing, snapshot testing, integration testing
