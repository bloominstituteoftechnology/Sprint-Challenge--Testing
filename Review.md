#In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

_describe_ is what we use to group tests (suites) to a particular part or component of an application- Describe could be used to group the tests written to apply to a singular API route (ex. 'Register route').

_it_ refers the specific test itself, i.e. in the testing of said API, it could be the status code returned upon

#What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?
Testing is essential to _providing stability and confidence_ in your code. Furthermore, it is the easiest way to _understand a codebase_ you interact with that was written by someone else. _Refactoring_ is a huge use case for testing, as it makes very easy to identify unintended regressions.

#Mention three types of automated tests.
_Unit tests_ for testing in the tradition of TDD/BDD,
_component testing_, which is useful when working with React,
and _snapshot_ testing which is generated by Jest and is very effective at finding regressions.
