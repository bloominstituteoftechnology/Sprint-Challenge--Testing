# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
-- describe() groups multiple related tests into a block called a test suite. This is good for organization.
-- it() is an alias for test() and it runs the actual test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
--In TDD, tests are written first and then you write code to pass the tests. I think this could be a time-saving approach because you can find bugs and syntax errors before moving on to the next test.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
-- Mocks are ways to test functions. A good use case would be to test an axios call without actually hitting the API.

4.  Mention three types of tests.
-- unit tests: testing a single function/object
-- integration tests: testing multiple functions/objects together 
-- snapshot tests: tests current output against previous output
