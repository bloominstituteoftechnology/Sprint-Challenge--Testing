# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    The `describe()` global organizes the `it()` globals into a test package/component whereas the `it()` global actually does the individual tests with an alotted description.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    The point of `TDD` is to write tests before writing your application and letting them direct you in how you make your application. This approach requires critical thinking and forethought into your application, much more than the `wing-it` attitude I took to making my React and server applications.
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    Unit testing, integration testing, and snapshot testing.
