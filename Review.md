# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

- `describe()` is a method that can contain multiple tests. We initialize a test with the method `it()` inside of the describe method

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

- Test driven design is the practice of designing a system based on the tests. It makes sure you are following a set of requirements. This can be good if your piece of software needs to interface with others in a specific way, or to match the expectations of input and output to what is expected.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?

- They are a way to simulate the behavior of real objects by recreating certain functionalities. They can be useful if the real objects are not practical to bring into the test.

4.  Mention three types of tests.
    - simple function tests
    - react component tests
    - api tests
