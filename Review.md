# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

    `descibe()` is like a container that groups together several related tests. `it()` is also known as `test()` is the method inside `describe()` that runs a test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

    The point of `Test Driven Development` is to ensure that the code we right both works and returns the data we expect it to return.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?

    `mock` functions are like "spies" that allow us to see the behavior of a function in a test instead of just looking at the final output of it.

4.  Mention three types of tests.

    Unit Testing
    Integration Testing
    End to End Testing
