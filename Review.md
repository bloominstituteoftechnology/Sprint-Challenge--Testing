# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
  `describe()` is used to group together related tests into one test suite. `it()` is used for each test in a test suite. These can be used for organization, so you know which function is being tested and all the tests that relate to that function.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
  Test Driven Development involves writing tests for functions first (which initially fail), then writing the minimal amount of code to pass the test, and then refactoring based on additional tests

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
  Mocks are dummy functions that imitate the real functions we are testing without actually affecting anything the real functions have access to.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
  - Unit tests
  - Component tests
  - Snapshots
