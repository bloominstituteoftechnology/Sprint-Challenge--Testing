# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe allows you test multiple related tests and keep tests organized into groups. Allows for nesting describe and it blocks as well. It just runs the tests.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
Uses unit tests to get something working and then is constantly refactored until the test is passed. Very straight-forward and isn't like BDD which is more thorough. 

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
They are used as a way to fake a backend api. Allow us to simulate the behaviors in a more controlled manner. 

4.  Mention three types of tests.
Unit tests, integration testing and snapshot testing.
