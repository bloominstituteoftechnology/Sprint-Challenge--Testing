# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

`describe() groups multiple tests into a test suite, while it() tests single functions.`

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

`Test Driven Development makes it easier to check that all pieces of software work individually and also together during development. I don't personally have much use for it while I make small apps (unless it allows me to automate stuff like server testing).`

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?

`Mocks are a way to create a virtual copy of a function in order to test its output. For example, a button can be mocked to test what happens when it is clicked.`

4.  Mention three types of tests.

`Unit, integration, snapshot.`
