# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

`describe()` creates a container for any number of related tests.
`it()` creates a test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

The point of TDD is to build a program by creating the test first, and then the component that corresponds to it.  This approach makes sense to me, and I've read that it actually saves you time in the long run, but right now it just seems way too slow to be helpful.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit testing - testing of the smallest possible components
Regression testing - testing whole system to see if things that previously worked have failed
Integration testing - testing combined pieces of the system to find problems due to the interaction between pieces
