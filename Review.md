# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe is how you break down your test into components, it is for individual test's.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
TDD is about writting test first before writting the actual code. In theory i like test driven development but in practice i feel like it takes way longer than it is actually worth doing. I much better like the aproach of writting test after writting you components, api , ect.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit Testing,
Api Testing,
UI testing
