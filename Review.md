# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
'describe' descibes a group of tests called a test suite. 'It' gives a particular test a description and defines what the expected result should be.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
Test Driven Development enforces better quality code by writting tests before production code is made and making the code pass those tests. It is a sound approach but there are drawbacks including more code to maintain and a longer production period. If the intention is for the application to live a long time, TDD will surely be beneficial.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
mocks are copies of a function used to test the function that was mocked. They are used when we want to test a function for its purity and expected behavior.

4.  Mention three types of tests.
unit testing.
client testing.
server testing.
