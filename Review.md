# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    describe() is used to organize your code and break up your tests into different categories based on what you are testing. it() is the method you should use when writing your tests, and it should include a specific description of what you are testing.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    The point of test driven development is to think about all the ways your code might fail before you even write the code. This can help you write more robust code from the outset.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    mocks are fake functions in jest. They let you make a function call in your tests, and can help you test parameters.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    unit tests, component tests, and snapshot tests
