# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe is used when you want a series of tests grouped together that are related in some way and it is used when you are doing a single test. Multiple it functions are typically in a describe block for organization.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
Test driven development (TDD) is when tests are written first then the code is written to pass all those test. I think that it is a lot more work in some cases, but can be useful for more complex functions.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit Testing
integration testing
functional testing
