# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    describe() is used to break your test suite into smaller components while it() is used to run the actual tests.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    To write test to check for exactly what you need to have happen. Then to write the code to pass all tests written. Depending on the project I could see the uses for TDD, but a lot depends on how much time, how complicated is the project, what is the size of the project, and how much planning you want to do.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    Mocking is what we do when we replace something that we can't control with something we do. It's good to use so you know what to expect in return.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    unit testing, smoke testing, functional testing.
