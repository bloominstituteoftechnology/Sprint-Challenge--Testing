# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    Describe lets the developer know which group of functions they're testing for while it() globals are the tests themselves

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    TDD reduces the case that you're going to have bugs in your programs. I'm personally a huge fan and will try to use it in my code more often

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    mocks are imitations of parts of your code(Ex: Mock Functions). Mocks can be used to simulate parts of your code without it have any unwanted effects

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    TDD,BDD, and unit testing
