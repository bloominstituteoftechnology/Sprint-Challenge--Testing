# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?


2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?


3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit tests are simple write and execute tests written by the developers that are useful when practicing TDD/BDD.
Component testing for component based frameworks work great against regression, verify changes to component output due to changes in state, but do not verifiy interaction between components.
Snapshot tests check current output against past output, are automatically generated by Jest, are very good at detecting regressions.
