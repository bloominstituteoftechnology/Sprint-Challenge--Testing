# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

describe() groups tests together into a suite, while it() is used to group together the bits to run a specific test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

TDD helps drive well written code by testing it as you go along. I think this approach makes sense when you are working with a team who may or may not know best practices for writing code.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?

 Mocks are a way to simulate certain things to allow tests to work. Some objects rely on other objects to complete what they are doing, so we use 'mocking' to simulate the objects they rely upon to fully test that our object works.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.


Unit test, component test, integration test.
