# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    > Describe focuses on telling you the main purpose of the follow tests. It's considered a test suite. The It block references each seperate test within a Describe block.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    > Test Driven Development tries to create tests for the application and develop to fit those tests. This is good for building new pieces of an application or starting from scratch. They let you specify exactly what you want a component of your application to do and then build to those specifications.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
    > Mocks are good to test functions that are used outside of what you're testing. They keep a record of the amount of times called and what it's called with, along with various other things.
4.  Mention three types of tests.
    > Unit, Integration, Regression, Snapshot
