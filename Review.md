# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
# discribe () breaks up the test suites while it() does the actual test
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
# the point is to test if what you wrote is really doing as you intend for it to do. What I think about it, I don't like it. In the case of react or server testing, as i'm creating those things I'm already seeing what they're doing without having to write another conveluted chunk of code.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
# A simulated object. It's good when you can't really use a real object. 
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
# jest, enzyme, supertest
