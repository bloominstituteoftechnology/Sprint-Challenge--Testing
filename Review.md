# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

<!-- 'describe' allows you to group test together and 'it' or 'test' is used for each individual test.  -->

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

<!-- This is where you write test trying to get them to fail. Then you fix it.  To me, it makes sense because you can see that your test is working -->

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?

<!-- They are used to simulate the function it is assigned to.  You can do this when you don't want to use the actual function -->

4.  Mention three types of tests.

<!-- We learned of three which are unit testing, client testing and web api testing.   -->
