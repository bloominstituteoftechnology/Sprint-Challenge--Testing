# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    describe() breaks the test suit into components. it() represents individual tests.
    describe() could be used for grouping each function.
    it() could be used inside of describe() for each test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    TDD makes it possible to have a high test-coverage of our codes, therefore, reduces having bugs that could be hard to track down.
    It takes some effort but I can see that it would save a lot of time in the long run.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    Mocks are objects created to simulate the behavior of the real objects for unit testing.
    API testing would be a great place to use them.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    Unit testing, integration testing, component testing.
