# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

1. Describe breaks your testing into smaller components. It is where the individual tests are done. A describe could include all of the tests for one function and each it would make up the individual tests

2. It encourages testing during development and allows you to do less tests at the end of development. I think that I already use this approach, but generally by manually testing my application along the way rather than using something like jest.

3. Unit tests, API tests, GUI tests
