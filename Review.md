# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe() is used to create components in the test suite, and it() makes individual tests.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

TDD lets you know what sort of errors to look for and design to avoid. It seems like a good practice to avoid unexpected bugs.

mock functions are used to simulate calling a function for purposed of a test without actually calling the function in the code being tested.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
- unit testing
