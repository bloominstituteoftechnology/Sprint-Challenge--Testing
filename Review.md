# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

# Describe() allows you to create a block of tests swith different subsections. It() is the same as test() and allows us to test for something that is expected within the code.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

# Is a process when you write and run your tests. It's point is to have higher test coverage and reduce the amount of bugs present in code. Generally, a good practice but time consuming.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?

# Mocks are function that allow us to test other functions. Keeps track of how many times the function was called and what it was called with.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.

# Unit tests, Integration tests, Component Testing
