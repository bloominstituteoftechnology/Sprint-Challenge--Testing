# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

`describe()` is for grouping related tests into one test suite. `it()` is an alias of test, which a test is the
    function that holds and executes the test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

  TDD is a development process that relies on the reputition of very short development cycles. Initially writing failing tests and then writing short code that makes the test pass and then refactoring. TDD is most likely a good way to prevent bugs in code before releases.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit testing, functional testing and regression testing.
