# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    Describe breaks the tests into components, while it is the specific tests run against them.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    Test Driven Development is soemthing that i really only see myself using for server testing, but i do see the benefit. It helps create a sort of 'guidelines' to follow when you're writing the code itself- and can help you catch bugs in the code quicker.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    mocks are mock functions, they are used to test functions by erasing the actual implentation of it, and capturing calls and paramaters to it. A good example would be testing a clickhandler.
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    unit testing, component testing, snapshot testing.
