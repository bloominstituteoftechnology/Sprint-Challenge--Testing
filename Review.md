# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
The `describe()` global in Jest breaks your test suite into components. The `it()` global is for individual tests which can go into a describe for a major component/piece of the project.  

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
Test driven development is an approach where you write tests for what you expect your app to do and then code that part of the app. This is different from coding first and then writing tests later. I can see it being beneficial when you know exactly how you want your app to perform but I can also see it slowing things down when you are not at a point where you know what your app should be doing or looking like. I feel like it's useful on a case-by-case basis. 

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit testing, component testing (e.g. React type frameworks), & integration testing are 3 types of automated tests but there are many others.
