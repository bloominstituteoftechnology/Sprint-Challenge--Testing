# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe groups together several related tests into one test suit. 'it' is the test that you are running.  

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

test driven development is test-first development. This allows you to code just enough to run that test. I beleive there are some positives and negs to this. The positive is: you do not have to go back and rewrite bad code. The neg is: it can take longer to get some meaningful coding up and running.


3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

unit tests
integration tests
component testing
snapshot testing
coverage testing
