# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
`describe()` is used to describe a set of scenarios. usually for grouping `it()`s. `it()` is used to describe a single scenario.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
`Test Driven Development` exists to provide a very secure development lifecycle. "confidence. Trust in the code." I think it slows down production time, unless you have 99% of the project specced out in the first place.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
