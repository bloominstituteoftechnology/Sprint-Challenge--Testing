# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
  #describe() breaks the test suite into components. it() is where you would actually perform individual tests.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
  #It could be useful since clients will almost always give you a list of things they want the end product to do.
  by taking the TDD approach, it could result in tidier code, safer refactoring and fewer bugs. 

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
  #Mocks are objects that simulate the behavior of a real methods in controlled ways. They are used for testing.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
  #unit tests, snapshot testing and component testing
