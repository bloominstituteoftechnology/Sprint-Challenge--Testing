# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    A: describe is used for labeling the tests that are inside of it. It is used to do the actual logic for the test.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    A: It forces you to plan out what the code will be doing, by knowing what you will be tetsing for. It helps to write better code. I think this is a good approach.
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    A: Unit testing, integration testing, and functional testing.
