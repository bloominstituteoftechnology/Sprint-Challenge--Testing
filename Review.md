# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    Test Driven Development ensures all of your code does exactly what it should do, no more no less. Though it is only as good as the tests that are written.

    Components
    Simulate objects to find potential bugs
