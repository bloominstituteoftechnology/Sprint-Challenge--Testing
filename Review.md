# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
  1.  `describe()` is a way to group related tests together. `it()` is the individual test.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
  1.  Test driven development forces you to decide and understand what your code is going to do before you write it. You write the tests first and then you write the code to pass those tests. I can see the value of coding this way, but it's very slow going and writing tests for code that doesn't exist yet is pretty challenging.
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
  1.  Unit testing tests individual functions or units of code. Integration testing tests how units work together. Component testing tests for functionality and appearnace of components in a framework like React.
