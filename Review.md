# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe() is used to hold it()s and test()s and organize them. Instead of having tests everywhere in a file, we can have tests regarding rendering under a describe and tests regarding methods under another describe.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

Test Driven Development is where the tests are written and then code is made to pass the tests. Personally, I think experience with TDD where the tests are written by someone else would be nice, but writing them myself and then writing the code to pass feels like doubling my work to the point that I'd almost rather test manually.
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit tests, regression tests, and integration tests.
