# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them? Describe helps to organize your tests. The it() will actually peform a test. It is good to use describe to organize your code into different categories such as paths and files. 
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach? To write test then code. It could be a good approach to detecting issues as you develop an application. I feel this approach can be helpful depending on the application. I also think that it can be tedious at times. 
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them? They are pretty much dummy scenario's. Where say I have a function that I want to test works correctly. A mock will mock parmaters being entered into the or perhaps an action being taken like a user click. 
4.  Mention three types of automated tests. You can test web API's react app's functions.  You can get status codes  or body types or actual bodies testing what the data returns. Snapshot testing will test if your code looks the same or has changed based on what is rendered to the UI. Unit testing, component testing etc.
