# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
'DESCRIBE' is used to breakdown your tests in terms of component or function by describing what they are. While 'IT' is describing how the parts of that component or functions should work. This means 'describes' are holding the 'it' globals, grouping them in a test suite.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
The point of test driven development is to help you build quality code for your actual functions. I think it's a really good way of thinking about it but it's kind of difficult switching up your way of thinking. Originally you just think of base functionality, but with TTD you don't see any functionality until later and you consider all cases of both success and failure.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit tests, integration tests, end to end
