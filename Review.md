# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
        describe() breaks your test suite into components to run tests on the specific component. it() is where you perform
    individual tests. 

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
        TDD is a great method it allows you to have your tests first then you code the problem with the given tests to make sure you pass the correct data
    or to make sure your app is running correctly.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
        Three types of automated testing would be web api testing, react and server testing soo far those are the three we learned about.
