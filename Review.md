# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe creates a block that groups together several related tests into one test suite.  It is for individual tests.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
Test Driven development is a design process where you write and run tests then write code for your application.  I think this approach is a good way to account for possible bugs and catch them before they can a problem in the application.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
Mocking is the process of creating objects that simulate real objects.  It can be used to isolate the behavior of an object by replacing the other objects that depend on it with mocks that simulate the behavior of the real objects.
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
component testing, snapshot testing, unit testing.
