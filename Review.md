# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
4.  Mention three types of tests.

1. describe() is used for putting the same test under the same section. it() is the actual code used for testing.
2. The point of TDD is to ensure that you hit all points of your code and ensure you don't leave bugs behind. It's a good way to think about how your app/program to function and cover unwanted bugs beforehand.
3. mocks are false input values, a good case would be using for components that need values from the parent component.
4. Unit Tests, Integration Tests, UI Tests
