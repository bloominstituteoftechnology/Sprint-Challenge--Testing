# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.

answers:

1.	describe can tell you what you're testing, and easily direct you to what component isn't passing tests
	without writing specifically which component is being tested under each test. it is used to write tests.
	
2.	I think a test-driven-development is kind of like a blueprint. I don't really see a difference
	between a TDD and simply having a good general plan.

3.	If memory serves, a mock is a very simple version of an app, like what we throw together to...
	literally test our tests. And that's the use; to make sure the tests work.

4.	server testing, API testing, testing scrips?
