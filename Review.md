# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

--> describe: group tests in one category, with similar theme
it: used for individual tests

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

--> have tests written before coding, so the requirements are clear. testing incrementally helps ensure previous tests works

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    --> unit, component, snapshot
