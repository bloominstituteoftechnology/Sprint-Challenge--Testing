    Mocks are good when trying to simulate an action or event caused by a user, such as clicks.
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    There is integration testing which tests objects under specific interaction.
    Unit testing which tests each individual part of the overall code.
    Regression testing is testing the changes done to the code to make sure the new code still behaves correctly.
