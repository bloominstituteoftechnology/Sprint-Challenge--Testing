# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    Describe() is where we define the component we are testing, and it() is where we define what each component should do.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    TDD is when we write our tests first with the goal in mind for our code and then we write up the code to fulfil the needs of the tests. I think this is great because it has us thinking about our code before we dig into writing it and makes it so that testing is a part of our code writing process.
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    Component testing, integration testing, snapshot testing
