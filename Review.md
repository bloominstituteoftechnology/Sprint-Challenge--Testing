# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

    - `describe()` groups together several related test cases in one “test suite” while `it()` runs the test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

    - It is a process for how to write and run tests on your program. Following this approach makes it possible to have a very high test-coverage and makes you feel confident on your code. I think this approach takes some effort to learn well, but spending time learning it will be worth it because it reduces the likelihood of having bugs in your tests, especially those bugs that are difficult to track down.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    - unit tests
    - component tests
    - snapshot tests
