# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
  describe() categorizes tests into groups, while it() gives the written and coded expected outcome for a particular function or component.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
  Test driven development requires the developer to think about fail cases of each part of their app/site before building it, requiring less editing afterwards.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
  mocks are objects created in testing to test the functionality of parts of the app/site. It simulates a real object that might be used.
