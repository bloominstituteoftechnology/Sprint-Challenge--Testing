# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe() is used to structure your test suite into groups of related tests, useful for describing the behavior of modules, components, or systems. It() is a function used to test specific behaviors or structures.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
TDD ensures that our software's behavior follows from its design by requiring: 1) that each behavior is specified in a test before any business logic is written, and 2) that business logic is written to conform to said tests.
A good testing practice will guard against incorrect behavior in edge cases and guard against regressions, while also clarifying the purpose and scope of the software.
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit, Integration, Regression
