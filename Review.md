# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

describe creates a block that groups the tests into one group, you can nest several tests into one describe. test or it on the other hand is the function that you will actually test for, whether it be a return statement or status code

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    test driven development would be to work around a project using testing as the foundation, this is good so that it allows a sturdy and robust code. you can suggest tests for what it should return and build your project around that
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
    mock functions are similar to a simulation, they allow a pseudo state to be called to ensure the test is running as intended
4.  Mention three types of tests.
    unit testing, component testing ,server testing
