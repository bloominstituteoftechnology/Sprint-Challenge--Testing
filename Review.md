# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    describe() will allow you to execute several tests on the same endpoint/groups tests together. "It" allows you to test a single endpoint or component.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    It is a development style in which you write the code to the tests that you've already made. You write tests first and then write code that can pass it. My opinion is neutral.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    Unit, integration, snapshot, component
