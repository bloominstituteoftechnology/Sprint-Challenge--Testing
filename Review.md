# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    Describe() is used to label an overall "umbrella" of tests or subdivide a suite of tests, and it() is used to label & execute the individual tests.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    With TDD we are able to to understand what we want from the application being created. As TDD is the process of writing tests prior to our application. This allows for minimal bugs and how we would like to handle errors.
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    unit tests, integration tests, and end to end
