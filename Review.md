# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

- Describe is a way to label a group of tests based on the larger concept they are testing. it() is another way to write test() and runs a specific test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

- Test Driven Development helps ensure code is correct, it helps as a guide when refactoring, and helps avoid regressions - which is code that unexpectedly breaks. I like testing. It was hard to get used to at first, but I can see its benefits.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

- Unit tests, Integration tests, and end to end.
