# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
'Describe' divides your tests under headers, 'it' is an individual test that can be within 'describe'

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
Prevent bugs during development, make sure all requirements are met, easier to refactor
Seems like a great method for making fewer mistakes, but at this point takes longer because I'm not familiar with it.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit, integration, snapshot, component
