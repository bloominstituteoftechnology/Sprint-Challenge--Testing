# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?---
 `describe` is for grouping tests for clarity, description of a test, while `it` is for housing them directly (although, it can still house multiple tests in the form of multiple `expect`s), required for test. 
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?---
 The point of T.D.D. is to be proactive in error handling. From the start of the project, someone who is doing TDD already is considering edge cases and is forcing themselves to handle them. 

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
A mock can imitate a typical dependency  for the sake of testing.
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.---
Unit testing , integration testing , regression testing.
