# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
`it()` is an alias for test. You use it to perform individual tests.
`describe()` groups together several related tests into one suite. You can also further subdivide the suite using describe. 
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
TDD is were you write tests before writing code. First you write a failing test then you write functional code that passes the test. Helps in regression and reduces the number of bugs in the code. 
3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
unit tests
integration tests
regression test
