# Please answer the following questions

- 1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

"Describe" groups tests together and nests them within a title. "It" allows you to assert tests on a given component.

- 2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

TDD is an approach in which we write tests and then make code that can pass them. Regression is stymied through the use of this approach. It's more difficult and unintuitive but has great benefits through implementation.

- 3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?

Mocks are used to capture function calls and view return values/instances of a constructor function possessing the keyword "new". They provide you a glimpse of a functions behavior.

- 4.  Mention three types of automated tests.

Units tests, integration tests, and snapshot testing.
