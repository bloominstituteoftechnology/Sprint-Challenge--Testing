# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe is used to group similar tests together. It is used to perform the individual tests

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
TDD is when you write the tests before the code. I think it feels somewhat unatural at first and takes time getting used to but is very good at producing code with fewer bugs.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit, Component, Snapshot
