# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?  with describe you can divide your test suite into different components and literally describe the function.  it is for performing individual tests, in which you describe specifically what the test is supposed to accomplish.

3.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?  TDD is when software development begins with writing tests rather than production code.  you start out writing tests to intentionally fail so you have a better understanding of what the code is actually doing.  and then move on to writing production code only to get passing tests.  then one can refactor.  one can use the outline red, green, refactor.  this way one can ensure the optimal coverage of code by tests.  i think it is awesome.

5.  Mention three types of automated tests.  unit testing, snapshot testing, integration testing.
