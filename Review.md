# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
'Describe' allows you group tests together, 'it' is used to individually test.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
TDD is where you write a test that fails, then write code to fix it. (red-green-refactor).
I think it is useful, it provides a good design pattern / good code that is less likely to break.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
Mocks are used to simulate the method/object it is assigned to.
Useful when you don't want to use the real method/object that it is testing.

4.  Mention three types of tests.
Unit testing, integration testing, snapshot testing
