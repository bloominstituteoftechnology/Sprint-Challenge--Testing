# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
- The `describe()` global is used to group related tests under a single `test suite`. This is useful in designing readable and organized tests.
- The `it()` global, also `test()`, is used to define the actual test and expected results.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
- The point of `TDD` is to guide development through hard coding requirements, improving organization and troubleshooting.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
- A `mock` is an implementation of an existing function used to test it's invocation. A good use case is when dealing with a resource request, custom data can be used with `mocks` to improve the test speed.
4.  Mention three types of tests.
- There are `unit tests`, `integration tests`, and `end to end tests`.
