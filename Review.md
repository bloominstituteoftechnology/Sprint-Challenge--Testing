# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
decribe() breaks the tests into different components and it() is used for individual tests. You can have several tests using it() inside a describe().

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
I think that if you are really good at TDD, you will become a better programmer. The approach being "what could go worng or how can I break the app" will make you think outside the box. It is slow but more secure.

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them? Mock objects are basically simulations of how your app works in a controlled environment. You use mocks to test the behavior of the app.


4.  Mention three types of automated tests. 
Functional Testing, Unit Testing, Regression Testing, Integration Testing.
