# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe() is used to label an overall "umbrella" of tests or subdivide a suite of tests, and it() is used to label & execute the individual tests.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

Test driven development is the method by where tests are written first, detailing what a certain piece of code should be doing, and then the appropriate code is attempted to be written fulfilling those tests. I think it can help a person zero in on certain edge/corner cases & potentially also help where multiple pieces of code are being designed by different individuals to function together & cohesively. It also helps for maintaining a large code base in future modifications.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit Testing
Component Testing
Integration Testing
