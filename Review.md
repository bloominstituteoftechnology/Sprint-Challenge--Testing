# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

- describe() labels the category of what we are testing. it() points to the functionality that we are testing.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

- TDD minimizes the amount of bugs as the project grows. By creating tests, we have a safety net that we can trust as we add / change features. Although it's requires more work I believe it should be non-negotiable.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

- unit test
- component testing
- snapshot testing
