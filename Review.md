# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

    I'm actually not sure on this one, I just know that describe holds groups of tests that start with it()

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

    TDD means that you write tests for your code before writing the code. It's sort of like bumpers around your project so that you know it's doing what you want, and only what you want, right from the start. I think it make sense when people are passing projects down to others to work on, but for myself right now I have a hard enough time making working code, test or not, hohohohoho. 

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?

    not sure if you mean mock functions or mock data, or both! mock data can be run through a test to see how the code responds, and mock functions can be used in a test to make sure they're being called at a certain time

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.

    unit testing, functional testing, data driven testing
