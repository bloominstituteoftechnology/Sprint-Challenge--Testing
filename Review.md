# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe builds a test suite, which gives a header to all nested it() globals. it() is an individual test used to test one specific thing. 
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
It makes it possible to have a high test-coverage. It also reduces the likelihood of bugs. I think that it is a good practice because it causes the developer to be more careful when writing code. 
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
A psuedo server used to test on. They are good to use when you need to isolate and test many different components that make up an API. 
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Component tests, integration tests, snapshot tests.
