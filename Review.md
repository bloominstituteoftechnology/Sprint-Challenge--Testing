# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    `describe()` creates a group or block of several tests that are related to one another, `it()` is used for individual tests
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    The purpose of this design process is to catch bugs before you get too deep down the rabbit hole of code, to fix them when they are caught early on to avoid rewriting huge chunks of code. This is a good process to save yourself a headache, and good for efficiency in case a problem occurs, but time consuming.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    `mocks` are used to simulate objects to find potential bugs or unintended behaviors. Allows for testing of functions' outputs, and what the functions called,  etc.
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    Component, unit, snapshot
