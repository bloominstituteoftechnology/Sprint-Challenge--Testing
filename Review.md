# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    Describe() organizes the tests into a category, while it() is for an individual test. Their different uses make the code easier to read.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    Test driven development gets you to start thinking about potential trouble spots beforehand. I think that although it can be more code to write, it can be very beneficial
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    Mocks are dummy objects or functions used to test functionality within the application
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
