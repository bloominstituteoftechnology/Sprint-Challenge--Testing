# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe groups tests into one nested, hierarchical block. It / test handles the function being tested for and returned.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
The point of TDD is to have thorough testing of code before adding it to a project. You also have to write tests before writing code, which can be tricky. I think it's a good approach for a technically competent team without urgent deadlines to produce. I like that it's less likely to result in buggy product code.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use case for them?
Mocks are simulated objects for testing code that has external dependencies to make sure it's functioning as planned.
4.  Mention three types of tests.
Server testing, snapshot testing, component testing
