# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

describe() is used as the test suite container for the specific parts of your app you are testing. it() is used for the tests themselves.

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

The point of TDD is to create tests for your code before you write it. I think it would make a complex app with many contributors easier to maintain.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

    1. Unit tests
    2. Integration tests
    3. Component tests
