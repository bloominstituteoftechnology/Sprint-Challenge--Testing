# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
describe is for breaking a test suite into different components. It is for each individual test. 
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
The point is to think about the structure of what your code will do before the code is written. I was not a fan mostly because I can't think of everything I need to test before I have written the code. 
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
Mocks are testing functions that can be passed to what your testing and let you see if the function is called and with what params. 
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit testing
Functional testing 
API testing
