# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    `describe` is like the parent to `it`. All tests for a component go inside of `describe()`, and each individual test is done with `it()`

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    The purpose of test driven development is to improve the quality of the code as it is being written. I think it makes a lot of sense on a large scale app to use TDD.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

    1. Unit tests
    2. Integration tests
    3. Component testing
    4. End to end
    5. Snapshot
    6. Coverage
    7. Functional
    8. Performance
    9. Acceptance
