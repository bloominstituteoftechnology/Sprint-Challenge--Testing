# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

We use desribe to first group an endpoint together then it will be for the indivdiual tests on that end point

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

Test driven devlopment is where we write our tests then design our endpoints to satisfy the tests. 
My view would be I enjoy writing my end points first then using tests to ensure my endpoints
are doing exactly what I intended for them to do. At that point you can see if you need to change
your endpoint up or add more tests.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.

I'm not exactly sure what is being asked here, but we can test react applications, javascript, or end points.
