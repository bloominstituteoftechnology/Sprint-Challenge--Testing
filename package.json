  "description": "* Keep Calm! Test On! * Now that you're familiar with the concepts of testing, your goal is to write documentation and tests for an API that is already in production. (This happens a lot :)) * Answers to your written questions will be recorded in _Answers.md_ * This is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can _reference_ any old code you may have, and the React Documentation, however, please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something. * **Just a friendly Reminder** Don't fret or get anxious about this, this is a no-pressure assessment that is only going to help guide you here in the near future. This is NOT a pass/fail situation.",
