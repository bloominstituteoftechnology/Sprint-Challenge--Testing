1. In Jest, what are the differences between beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach, and afterEach? When do they run? What are they used for?
# BeforeAll is when you run a code before you run any test. This is good for connecting mongoose with mongo before running any test.
# Afterall is when you run a code after you run all the test. This is good for disconnecting mongoose with mongo after running all test.
# BeforeEach is when you run a code before each test. This is good for reseting your fake data before each test.
# AfterEach is when you run a code after each test.  This is good for deleting your database because you don't want to populate your database.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you personally think about this approach?
# The point of Test Driven Development is that after you write a test the test should fail because you haven't written the code to make it pass.  If the test pass before you write the code to make it pass then something is wrong with your code.  
3. What is a mock function? How do we use it to test a callback passed to a function?
# Mock function is when you create dummy function which then you can perform test to see if your real code will do what it is suppose to do.
4. Mention three types of tests.
# There is unit testing which is fast and simple to write and execute.
# There is also component testing which is to test for appearance and functionality of a component and is highly sensitive.
# There is also snapshot testing which is automatically generated by Jest. It checks current output against prior output.
5. What type of test performs database operations against a real server.
# I believe this is when we use Supertest to create simulation of what you should get back from the database with your request test and your response test.
