In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?
    Describe is used as a way to cluster or group the tests in a meaningful way. This makes it easies to reference the tests when needed.
    It() is used for the actual individual tests. Normally it can be found nested with a describe.


What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?
    The point of TDD is to make code that is more predicable and has less errors. The idea is to create the tests even before building the functionality. To do this you have to know that the functionality should result in. It is a good approach but a little challenging to implament for myself. I prefer to at least sudo code the main part.

Mention three types of automated tests.
    Three types that I can think of are Unit Testing, API testing and end to end testing. They each have their own purpose and can be used together.
