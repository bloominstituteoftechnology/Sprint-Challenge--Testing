1. In Mocha, what are the differences between `before`, `after`, `beforeEach`, and `afterEach`? When do they run? What are they used for?

Before happens before all the tests, after, after all the tests; beforeEach/afterEach happens before/after each individual test.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you personally think about this approach?

The point of it seems to be to make sure that all aspects of your code are testable. I personally wouldn't like it if there was any "creativity" involved, but if there was a laid out spec to follow, then it's all right. 

3. What is a `spy` in `sinon`? How do we use it to effectively test a `callback`?

I'm not 100% sure on sinon, yet, but it seems to be to be used as a standin to pretend to be a function (or anything else, like a callback) in the code...to see how our code interacts with it.
