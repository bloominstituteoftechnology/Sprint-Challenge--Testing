1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    A. Describe() breaks the test suite into components making it easier to read.  It() is used inside describe() and 
        actually runs the individual tests.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    A. Test Driven Development is the idea of designing your tests for your code before writing your code.  This way
        when you write your code you will have a better idea of how the code works.  Then you write your code and make sure
        the code passes all of the tests.  I see the benefit of this approach although I often seem to start doing this and then
        when I start writing the code, I won't transisition back into writing tests until the code is mostly finished.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
    A. Unit testing, snapshot testing, component testing.
