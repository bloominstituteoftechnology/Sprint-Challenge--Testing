# Sprint Challenge - Testing

1. In Mocha, 'before' is run once before all the tests in the describe and 'after' is run once after all the tests in a describe. 'beforeEach' is run before each test in a descibe and 'afterEach' is run after each test. The one that should be used depends on what the test is actually testing.

2. The idea behind Test Driven Development is that by creating the tests before the actual coding process it allows a developer to foresee bugs before the code is written and creates a 'less buggy' solution code. Personally, I don't think I have enough experience writing both styles of code and can see benefits to both styles of coding. As much as I've hated learning Test Driven Development, I actually think it's a great way to code. Bugs in other sections of our curriculum have driven me crazy and I can see an enormous amount of benefit in developing tests for methods that haven't been created yet. I hate to admit it but I think TDD may result in cleaner and better functioning programming. 

3. In 'sinon' a spy is a function that records argument, return value, the value of 'this' and exceptions thrown for all its 'calls'.
