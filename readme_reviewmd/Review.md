# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    - Describe provides a way to organize your tests and give a description for the output so that it is easier to read. It speaks specifically to the test you are running. 

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    - Test Driven Development allows us to build our test in tandum with our program, which forces us to think through the potential errors that may occur. I think this is a very slow way to go about building a program and seeks an impossible outcome, namely having a human being predict the future developer-driven/user-driven bugs, which are literally infinite. 

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    - Mocks help us to mock component utlization to allow us to test functionally driven parts that may not be accessable in the current component. 

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    - Functional Unit Testing, React Testing and API Testing.
