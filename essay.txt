1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

   describe breaks your test suite into components. Depending on your test strategy, you might have a describe for each function in your class, each module of your plugin, or each user-facing piece of functionality. (You can also nest describes to further subdivide the suite).

   it is where you perform individual tests. You should be able to describe each test like a little sentence, such as "it calculates the area when the radius is set". You shouldn't be able to subdivide tests further-- if you feel like you need to, use describe instead.


2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach? 
   the purpose of TDD is to force developers to right better scalable code by creating test cases first and then creating writting code that passes those test cases.

   While I do not "hate" this approach I think Jest is irritating for reasons no one can explain and if it was a person I'd stab it in the face.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
   Unit test, API test, GUI test....I think we only talked about one sooooo the name is all I got
